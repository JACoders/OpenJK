# SORRY FOR THE HISTORY CHANGES! #

For legal reasons we had to make changes to the history. This likely broke every forker's repo. See [here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase.html#_recovering_from_upstream_rebase) for how to fix if you've changed anything, or just delete your github fork and local folder and start over if you haven't.

* Tweaks to the cvar code to make it more strict in terms of read only/cheats/init.  Fixes a lot of broken rules with cvars.
* Cheats are now defaulted to 1 in menu.  Do not be alarmed, starting normally will disable them or connecting to a non-cheat server. This allows cheats to work properly while playing back demos.

* Add sv_lanForceRate (Defaults to 1) Feature was already enabled, but not toggleable.
* Timescale frametime fixes.  Frametime < 1 is no longer possible (bad things happen)
* Tweaked globalservers master server command a bit for better verbosity.
* Fixed a lot of formatting security holes.
* Several Out-of-bounds memory access and memory leaks fixed.
* Added fontlist command.  Useful for when making mods with custom fonts.
* New serverside kick commands kickall kickallbots and kicknum (alias).
* Improved command line parsing based off of ioquake3 patches.
* Improved echo command by preserving colors based off of ioquake3 patches.
* Improved GL_Extensions using ioquake3 to prevent crashes on newer cards.
* Removed CD Check Code
* Removed CD Key Code
