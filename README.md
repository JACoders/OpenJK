The purpose of this project is to maintain and improve the Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast games, developed by Raven Software. This project does not attempt to rebalance or otherwise modify core gameplay.

Major enhancement changes are very low priority at this time unless patches are made available and which do not alter the core functionality of gameplay or the stock renderer itself.

Please use discretion when making issue requests on GitHub. The [JKHub sub-forum](http://jkhub.org/forum/51-discussion/) is a better place for support queries, discussions, and feature requests.

## Jedi Outcast Support ##

_Do not make issues regarding Jedi Outcast problems at this time. It is considered mostly unfinished, broken, and to be used at your own risk!_

There is no Multiplayer code for JK2MP at all on our repository at this time. The Single-player support must be explicitly turned on in your own compile. The pre-built versions will not include this.

## 64-bit Support

64-bit is currently supported on non-Windows platforms.

## Installation ##

First, install Jedi Academy. If you don't already own the game you can buy it from online stores such as [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/6020/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Jedi-Knight-Academy-Pc/dp/B0000A2MCN) or [Play](http://www.play.com/Games/PC/4-/127805/Star-Wars-Jedi-Knight-Jedi-Academy/Product.html?searchstring=jedi+academy&searchsource=0&searchtype=allproducts&urlrefer=search). Then unpack the OpenJK zip file to your Jedi Academy GameData folder.
