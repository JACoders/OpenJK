# OpenJK and then some

This is a project that uses OpenJK, but adds a couple features that I believe should have been made. If you're unfamiliar with OpenJK, [click here](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK/blob/master/README.md) to read more about it.

# Changes and additions
1.00
* All taunts are available in all game modes (meditate, gloat, flourish, etc)
* Private duels now start with full health and shield, and can be changed via new cvars (g_duelStartHealth and g_duelStartArmor)
* Results of a private duel are displayed to all, with the remaining health of the winning player

1.01
* Added a cvar to toggle idle animations (personal annoyance of mine) - g_useIdleAnims

1.02
* restored the ability to use map glitches via dmflags 520

1.03
* Cheats are now toggled via rcon - sv_cheats

A couple more to come soon.
