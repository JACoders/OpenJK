The purpose of this project is to maintain and improve the Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast games, developed by Raven Software. This project does not attempt to rebalance or otherwise modify core gameplay.

Major enhancement changes are very low priority at this time unless patches are made available and which do not alter the core functionality of gameplay or the stock renderer itself.

Please use discretion when making issue requests on github. The [JKHub sub-forum](http://jkhub.org/forum/51-discussion/) is a better place for larger discussions on changes that aren't actually bugs.

## Jedi Outcast Support ##

_Do not make issues regarding Jedi Outcast support problems at this time.  It is considered mostly unfinished, broken and use at your own risk!  (We know things like saving and using the JK2 Mode are broken for sure)_

There is no Multi-Player code for JK2MP at all on our repository at this time.   The Single-Player support must be explicitly turned on in your own compile.  The prebuilt versions will not include this.

## 64-bit Support

64-bit is now mostly working on non-Windows platforms.

## Installation ##

First, install Jedi Academy. If you don't already own the game you can buy it from online stores such as [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/6020/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Jedi-Knight-Academy-Pc/dp/B0000A2MCN) or [Play](http://www.play.com/Games/PC/4-/127805/Star-Wars-Jedi-Knight-Jedi-Academy/Product.html?searchstring=jedi+academy&searchsource=0&searchtype=allproducts&urlrefer=search). Then unpack the OpenJK zip file to your Jedi Academy GameData folder.
