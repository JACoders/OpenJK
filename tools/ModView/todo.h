/*

This file is just for keeping notes about stuff still to do....			


	Should really change the .frames file reader to use CGenericParser, instead of custom code.

	Do surface-bolting when jake finishes it
	Show bolt-surfaces with some sort of highlight.
	Show model origin as alternative RGB lines?


	(surface common normals done as auto in carcass, but REM'd out until Gil final-decides XSI import method)

	remote play of frame numbers?
	
	thumbnail xmit?	

	FPS actual?
