"wait"		Seconds between triggerings, 0 default, number < 0 means one time only.
"random"	wait variance, default is 0
"delay"		how many seconds to wait to fire targets after tripped
"hiderange" As long as NPC's head is in this trigger, NPCs out of this hiderange cannot see him.  If you set an angle on the trigger, they're only hidden from enemies looking in that direction.  the player's crouch viewheight is 36, his standing viewheight is 54.  So a trigger thast should hide you when crouched but not standing should be 48 tall.
"target2"	The trigger will fire this only when the trigger has been activated and subsequently 'cleared'( once any of the conditions on the trigger have not been satisfied).  This will not fire the "target" more than once until the "target2" is fired (trigger field is 'cleared')
"speed"		How many seconds to wait to fire the target2, default is 1
"noise"		Sound to play when the trigger fires (plays at activator's origin)

Variable sized repeatable trigger.  Must be targeted at one or more entities.
so, the basic time between firing is a random time between

/*QUAKED trigger_push (.1 .5 .1) ? PLAYERONLY CHECKCLEAR LINEAR NPCONLY RELATIVE CONVEYOR x INACTIVE MULTIPLE
Must point at a target_position, which will be the apex of the leap.
This will be client side predicted, unlike target_push
PLAYERONLY - only the player is affected
LINEAR - Instead of tossing the client at the target_position, it will push them towards it.  Must set a "speed" (see below)
CHECKCLEAR - Every 1 second, it will check to see if it can trace to the target_position, if it can, the trigger is touchable, if it can't, the trigger is not touchable
NPCONLY - only NPCs are affected
RELATIVE - instead of pushing you in a direction that is always from the center of the trigger to the target_position, it pushes *you* toward the target position, relative to your current location (can use with "speed"... if don't set a speed, it will use the distance from you to the target_position)
CONVEYOR - acts like a conveyor belt, will only push if player is on the ground ( should probably use RELATIVE also, if you want a true conveyor belt )
INACTIVE - not active until targeted by a target_activate
MULTIPLE - multiple entities can touch this trigger in a single frame *and* if needed, the trigger can have a wait of > 0

wait - how long to wait between pushes: -1 = push only once
speed - when used with the LINEAR spawnflag, pushes the client toward the position at a constant speed (default is 1000)
