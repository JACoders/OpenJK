 *  creates a new thread for the calling process with the SDL_CreateThread()
 *  API. There is a problem with this, that only the RTL of the SDL.DLL will
 *  be initialized for those threads, and not the RTL of the calling 
 *  application!
 *  
 *  To solve this, we make a little hack here.
 *  
 *  We'll always use the caller's _beginthread() and _endthread() APIs to
 *  start a new thread. This way, if it's the SDL.DLL which uses this API,
 *  then the RTL of SDL.DLL will be used to create the new thread, and if it's
 *  the application, then the RTL of the application will be used.
 *  
 *  So, in short:
 *  Always use the _beginthread() and _endthread() of the calling runtime 
 *  library!
