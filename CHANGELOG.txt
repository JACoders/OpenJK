* Fixes some voting issues relating to clients disconnecting and/or switching teams.
* Fixed some voting issues relating to bad percentage calculation for passing/failing.
* Fixed some item prediction errors in team games.  (Item prediction still sucks in general though)
* Fixed potential out of bounds in sound code.

* Rosh should no longer randomly die due to falling damage on the first level.
* Fixed Gamma Clamp on WinXP+
* Fixed weather system incorrectly throwing up a warning with shader data if weather system was unable to parse a vector correctly.
* Fixed buffer overflow in client side rcon command.

* Tweaks to the cvar code to make it more strict in terms of read only/cheats/init.  Fixes a lot of broken rules with cvars.
+ Cheats are now defaulted to 1 in menu.  Do not be alarmed, starting normally will disable them or connecting to a non-cheat server. This allows cheats to work properly while playing back demos.
* Fixed cvar commands that allow you to "cg_thirdPerson !" prevent you from typing out longer strings starting with a ! as the value.
+ Optimized MP shader loader.  This also fixes some cases where duplicate shaders that are wrong were being used.
