# OpenJK

OpenJK is a community effort to maintain and improve the game and engine powering Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast, while maintaining _full backwards compatibility_ with the existing games and mods.  
This project does not intend to add major features, rebalance, or otherwise modify core gameplay.

Our aims are to:

- Improve the stability of the engine by fixing bugs and improving performance.
- Support more hardware (x86_64, Arm, Apple Silicon) and software platforms (Linux, macOS)
- Provide a clean base from which new code modifications can be made.
