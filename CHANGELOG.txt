New Cvars
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
g_autoRoll* - default is 1, if 1 default JA behavior, if 0 you have to be holding USE to roll
g_char_forcePowerMax* - requires level restart, controls number of player force points
g_char_forceRegen* - requires level restart, controls force point regen rate of player
g_char_parryBonus* - same as .sab file setting but applied on savegame load for player
g_char_breakParryBonus* - same as .sab file setting but applied on game load for player
g_handicap* - can go up to 200 now
g_saberDamageScale* - this scales saber damage, and is saved with your savegame. This effect stacks on top of the effect caused by g_saberMoreRealistic.
g_saberDeflectAutoAim* - if 0, blaster deflections are not auto-aimed but go in the direction of the crosshair with randomness
based on Saber Defense level
g_saberForceDrains - if 1 special moves drain the amount of FP from the next cvar, katas not affected
g_saberForceDrainAmount - if g_saberForceDrains is 1, special moves drain this amount of FP, katas not affected
g_saberLockSuperBreaks* - if 1 default JA behavior of saber locks, if 0 no super breaks (1-hit KOs) ever happen after saber locks
g_saberMoreRealistic* - no longer write-protected
g_weaponVelocity*, g_weaponAltVelocity* - use this to multiply the speed of most projectiles

Gameplay mechanics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Force powers (activated with g_forceNewPowers 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Force Jump height for all levels increased by 25%
- Force Pull level 1 pulls weapons only, level 2 can knockdown, level 3 can pull toward you a little bit
- ***Force Sense gives limited snipershot dodging ability (you might need to hold down Use)
- Force Speed decreases FP cost of sniper shot dodging at Level 3 (for auto-dodging anyway)
- **Force Protect 1/2/3 gives only 10/20/40% damage reduction against saber attacks instead of 25/50/75%
- Force Heal costs slightly fewer force points at Level 3 if I remember correctly

NPC AI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jedi AI changes...
- Improvements to AI governing use of JA-exclusive abilities and powers...
only use Force Rage if close to the player and if have > 25% HP, only kick if close to the player,
only use saber attack katas if close to the player
- NPC Jedi recover from knockdown very fast on high difficulties (no easy marios for the win)
- NPC Jedi re-activate their sabers faster after being gripped or drained based on difficulty and NPC rank
- NPC Jedi will try very hard to dodge your attacks if you knock their saber throw to the ground (before they were more apt to just stand there)
- Light Jedi with non-dark Jedi AI (class_reborn, class_desann, etc.) classes don't attack surrendered or unarmed enemies
- Force Cultists react properly to explosives/sniper shots/saber throws
- Force Cultists punch sometimes
- Non-saber NPCs with Class_Reborn try extra hard to dodge saber attacks
- Non-saber NPCs with Class_Reborn cannot cartwheel without Force Jump 1

General NPC AI changes...
- **Grenadier Grans will still try punching sometimes even if your saber is drawn
- **NPCs surrender more like JK2 (more consistent, once they decide to surrender they will usually stay surrendered)
- Allied NPCs receive 150%/125%/100% HP for Padawan/Jedi/Jedi Knight difficulties now instead of 100%/125%/150% like enemies
- Assassin Droids now fire while shielded
- Class_Rodian/Class Imperial at commander rank use alt-fire with WP_BLASTER


Saber System (activated with g_saberNewCombat 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Saber Offense gives a base "attack power" (AP) (+2/+4/+6)
- Saber Defense gives a base "defense power" (DP) (+2/+4/+6) and a number of block points (BP, is equal to 1 + your SD level IIRC)
- "attack power" is modified by saber style (-2/0/+2/-1/+1/-1/+1 for Fast/Med/Strong/Duals/Staff/Tavion/Desann)
- Desann style is as strong as Red if you are CLASS_DESANN, otherwise it does not cause knockdown as often as Red, and is slightly
weaker
- style attack chaining altered:
can only chain 2 slashes if running, staff and duals cannot chain infinitely (5 slash maximum now), chain counts are also not
random (Medium can always chain 5 slashes while walking for example)

How saber combat then works:
- AP > DP = attack blocked but lose a number of BP equivalent to AP - DP
- all BP lost = guard crushed
- BPs regenerate about 1 per second if walking/standing still (total BP = your Saber Def. level + 1 if I remember correctly)
- special attacks ignore BP: either crush guard or are blocked partially

Other saber-related changes
- player's ability to parry saber attacks and blaster fire is improved while walking or standing still for Medium and Strong
styles
- Saber Defense 0 cannot block blaster fire (or was it just a super narrow arc? can't remember...)
- A saber with autoblocking 0 now has a narrow blocking arc for the player (so you can't cheat and block super easy)
- Holding Use and standing still will let you try to manual block blaster bolts as it currently does in Base JA, however the arc is super narrow

Melee changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Player can use kicks with any saber type by default, you must use +forcefocus to saberthrow (bind this to a key, maybe your mousewheel click-down)
- Player's melee abilities determined by Saber Offense level (1 = punches and kicks, 2 = katas, 3 = spin kicks)
- if you're not cheating (using g_debugMelee or iknowkungfu)... Player melee katas have less range, must be aimed more precisely, and do not work on certain types of enemies
- Spin/Flip kicks are only enabled for Saber Offense 3 but do slightly more damage
- Spin Kicks are possible on demand by holding Use and pressing the Alt Attack button, however costs 10 FP (the auto version doesn't cost any)
- **Knockdown to Jedi happens only if your Saber Offense >= their Saber Defense
- Player punches do 7/5 damage now instead of 6/3 and aren't randomized
- **Force Speed punching is more consistent now and less cheap (never did actually test)
- **Heavy/Slow Melee punching is specifically associated with Chewbacca, Class_Gran, and Class_Trandoshan, other NPC types will punch
more quickly but weakly if given WP_MELEE

Other additions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- visual effect for blocking Force Lightning with your lightsaber (it's subtle but there, it just plays a reverse-direction version of the Lightning level 1 effect, will make this a separate file)
- rolls and acrobatics are possible in 1st Person now

Future ideas
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to do -
- *savegame screenshots
- *separate cvar for player HP and Shields
- reborn masters with debounce to limit constant saber throwing + lightning
- *NPCs avoid cliffs
- *extra fields in Weapons.dat such as NPCDamageMult, NPCAltDamageMult, saber ignition/deignition time
- force push strong version, mindtrick changes
- doing a full slash when starting saber off regardless of movement
- *camera controls (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th person)
- better AI for NPCs deciding to surrender

- balance staff and duals blocking
- finish new NPC fields
- make sure saber stats save correctly


* would like to implement into OpenJK
** not completely tested but should work
*** incomplete/unfinished/not working completely
