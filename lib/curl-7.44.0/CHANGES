  http2: discard frames with no SessionHandle
  
  Return 0 instead of NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE if we can't locate the
  SessionHandle. Apparently mod_h2 will sometimes send a frame for a
  stream_id we're finished with.
  
  Use nghttp2_session_get_stream_user_data and
  nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data to identify SessionHandles instead
  of a hash.

- [Isaac Boukris brought this change]

  NTLM: handle auth for only a single request
  
  Currently when the server responds with 401 on NTLM authenticated
  connection (re-used) we consider it to have failed.  However this is
  legitimate and may happen when for example IIS is set configured to
  'authPersistSingleRequest' or when the request goes thru a proxy (with
  'via' header).
  
  Implemented by imploying an additional state once a connection is
  re-used to indicate that if we receive 401 we need to restart
  authentication.
  
  Closes #363

Kamil Dudka (30 Jul 2015)
- http: move HTTP/2 cleanup code off http_disconnect()
  
  Otherwise it would never be called for an HTTP/2 connection, which has
  its own disconnect handler.
  
  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
  closing the oldest one." message.
  
  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not
  actually used.  This commit makes it work again although I suspect the
  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.

  HTTP: ignore "Content-Encoding: compress"
  
  Currently, libcurl rejects responses with "Content-Encoding: compress"
  when CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING is set to "". I think that libcurl should
  treat the Content-Encoding "compress" the same as other
  Content-Encodings that it does not support, e.g. "bzip2". That means
  just ignoring it.

  (NSS, wolfSSL and DarwinSSL) so we could possibly accommodate them at

  ntlm_wb: Fix theoretical memory leak
  
  Static analysis indicated that my commit 9008f3d564 ("ntlm_wb: Fix

  before returning an error.
  
  Fix this.

  around openssl 0.9.8f, and the use of it in lib/vtls/openssl.c breaks
  builds with older openssls (certainly with 0.9.8b, which is the latest
  older version I have to try with).

- FTP: do the HTTP CONNECT for data connection blocking
  
  ** WORK-AROUND **
  
  The introduced non-blocking general behaviour for Curl_proxyCONNECT()
  didn't work for the data connection establishment unless it was very
  fast. The newly introduced function argument makes it operate in a more
  blocking manner, more like it used to work in the past. This blocking
  approach is only used when the FTP data connecting through HTTP proxy.
  
  Blocking like this is bad. A better fix would make it work more
  asynchronously.

- schannel: schannel_recv overhaul
  
  This commit is several drafts squashed together. The changes from each
  draft are noted below. If any changes are similar and possibly
  contradictory the change in the latest draft takes precedence.
  
  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/244
  Reported-by: Chris Araman
  
  %%
  %% Draft 1
  %%
  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
  and return its count
  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
  isn't already set-- and return -1
  - narrow the Win2k workaround to only Win2k
  
  %%
  %% Draft 2
  %%
  - Trying out a change in flow to handle corner cases.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 3
  %%
  - Back out the lazier decryption change made in draft2.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 4
  %%
  - Some formatting and branching changes
  - Decrypt all encrypted cached data when len == 0
  - Save connection closed state
  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
  
  %%
  %% Draft 5
  %%
  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
  connection isn't closed.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 6
  %%
  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
  
  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
  
  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
  
  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
  received during the renegotiation only.
  
  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
  
  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 7
  %%
  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
  
  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
  
  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
  
  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 8
  %%
  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
  
  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

  schannel: Add support for optional client certificates
  
  Some servers will request a client certificate, but not require one.
  This change allows libcurl to connect to such servers when using
  schannel as its ssl/tls backend. When a server requests a client
  certificate, libcurl will now continue the handshake without one,
  rather than terminating the handshake. The server can then decide
  if that is acceptable or not. Prior to this change, libcurl would
  terminate the handshake, reporting a SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS
  error.

  http2: Copy data passed in Curl_http2_switched into HTTP/2 connection buffer
  
  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by
  nghttp2_session_mem_recv() will write stream specific data into
  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The
  fix is first copy the passed data to HTTP/2 connection buffer,
  httpc->inbuf, and call nghttp2_session_mem_recv().

- CURLOPT_COOKIE.3: Explain that the cookies won't be modified

- read_callback: move to SessionHandle from connectdata
  
  With many easy handles using the same connection for multiplexing, it is

  SessionHandle so that callbacks and callback data work fine even when
  many easy handles share the same physical connection.

- http2: show stream IDs in decimal
  
  It makes them easier to match output from the nghttpd test server.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  http2: Faster http2 upload
  
  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we
  return NGHTTP2_ERR_DEFERRED, and nghttp2 library removes this stream
  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
  and upload speed becomes normal.

  Require nghttp2 v1.0.0
  
  This commit requires nghttp2 v1.0.0 to compile, and migrate to v1.0.0,
  and utilize recent version of nghttp2 to simplify the code,
  
  First we use nghttp2_option_set_no_recv_client_magic function to
  detect nghttp2 v1.0.0.  That function only exists since v1.0.0.
  
  Since nghttp2 v0.7.5, nghttp2 ensures header field ordering, and
  validates received header field.  If it found error, RST_STREAM with
  PROTOCOL_ERROR is issued.  Since we require v1.0.0, we can utilize
  this feature to simplify libcurl code.  This commit does this.
  
  Migration from 0.7 series are done based on nghttp2 migration
  document.  For libcurl, we removed the code sending first 24 bytes
  client magic.  It is now done by nghttp2 library.
  on_invalid_frame_recv callback signature changed, and is updated

  http2: Read data left in connection buffer after pause
  
  Previously when we do pause because of out of buffer, we just throw
  away unread data in connection buffer.  This just broke protocol
  framing, and I saw occasional FRAME_SIZE_ERROR.  This commit fix this
  issue by remembering how much data read, and in the next iteration, we
  process remaining data.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  http2: Fix streams get stuck
  
  This commit fixes the bug that streams get stuck if stream gets some
  DATA, and stream->closed becomes true at the same time.  Previously,
  in this condition, after we processed DATA, we are going to try to
  read data from underlying transport, but there is no data, and gets
  EAGAIN.  There was no code path to evaludate stream->closed.

- http2: store incoming h2 SETTINGS

- pipeline: move function to pipeline.c and make static
  
  ... as it was only used from there.

- IsPipeliningPossible: http2 can always "pipeline" (multiplex)

- http2: remove debug logging from on_frame_recv

- http2: remove the closed check in http2_recv
  
  With the "drained" functionality we can get here slightly asynchronously
  so the stream have have been closed but there is pending data left to
  read.

- http2: bump the h2 buffer to 8K

- http2: Curl_read should not use the single buffer
  
  ... as it does for pipelining when we're multiplexing, as we need the
  different buffers to store incoming data correctly for all streams.

- http2: more debug outputs

- http2: leave WAITPERFORM when conn is multiplexed
  
  No need to wait for our "spot" like for pipelining

- http2: force "drainage" of streams
  
  ... which is necessary since the socket won't be readable but there is
  data waiting in the buffer.

- http2: move the mem+len pair to the stream struct

- http2: more stream-oriented data, stream ID 0 is for connections

- http2: move lots of state data to the 'stream' struct
  
  ... from the connection struct. The stream one being the 'struct HTTP'
  which is kept in the SessionHandle struct (easy handle).
  
  lookup streams for incoming frames in the stream hash, hashing is based
  on the stream id and we get the SessionHandle for the incoming stream
  that way.

- HTTP: partial start at fixing up hash-lookups on http2 frame receival

- http: a stream hash for h2 multiplexing

- http: a stream hash for h2 multiplexing

- http2: debug log when receiving unexpected stream_id

- http2: move stream_id to the HTTP struct (per-stream)

- Curl_http2_setup: only do it once and enable multiplex on the server
  
  Once we know we are HTTP/2 enabled we know the server can multiplex.

- http: switch on "pipelining" (multiplexing) for HTTP/2 servers
  
  ... and do not blacklist any.

- README.pipelining: removed
  
  All the details mentioned here are better documented in man pages

- Curl_conncache_add_conn: fix memory leak on OOM

- CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS: host = host name + port number

- conncache: keep bundles on host+port bases, not only host names
  
  Previously we counted all connections to a specific host name and that
  would be used for the CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS check for example,
  while servers on different port numbers are normally considered
  different "origins" on the web and should thus be considered different
  hosts.

- bundles: merged into conncache.c
  
  All the existing Curl_bundle* functions were only ever used from within
  the conncache.c file, so I moved them over and made them static (and
  removed the Curl_ prefix).

- hostcache: made all host caches use structs, not pointers
  
  This avoids unnecessary dynamic allocs and as this also removed the last
  users of *hash_alloc() and *hash_destroy(), those two functions are now
  removed.

- multi: converted socket hash into non-allocated struct
  
  avoids extra dynamic allocation

- connection cache: avoid Curl_hash_alloc()
  
  ... by using plain structs instead of pointers for the connection cache,
  we can avoid several dynamic allocations that weren't necessary.

  hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such
  requests would also be authenticated per request.

  The factor of 8 is a bytes-to-bits conversion factor, but pkt_size and

  cyassl: Fix library initialization return value
  
  (Curl_cyassl_init)
  - Return 1 on success, 0 in failure.
  
  Prior to this change the fail path returned an incorrect value and the
  evaluation to determine whether CyaSSL_Init had succeeded was incorrect.
  Ironically that combined with the way curl_global_init tests SSL library
  initialization (!Curl_ssl_init()) meant that CyaSSL having been
  successfully initialized would be seen as that even though the code path
  and return value in Curl_cyassl_init were wrong.

  CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES.3: Mainly SHOUTcast servers use "ICY 200"
  
  Icecast versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.12 would reply with "ICY 200"
  under certain conditions:
  
      client_wants_icy_headers (connection_t *con)
      {
              const char *val;
  
              if (!con)
                      return 1;
  
              val = get_user_agent (con);
              if (!val || !val[0] || strcmp (val, "(null)") == 0)
                      return 1;
  
              if (con->food.client->use_icy)
                      return 1;
              if (strncasecmp (val, "winamp", 6) == 0)
                      return 1;
              if (strncasecmp (val, "Shoutcast", 9) == 0)
                      return 1;
  
              return 0;
      }
  
  So mainly if there is no 'user agent' or it is '(null)' or contains
  'winamp' or 'Shoutcast'.
  
  No mainstream distribution carries Icecast 1.3.x anymore, after all
  it was released in 2002 and superseded by Icecast 2.x.

  - makes Curl_safefree() not check the pointer before free()
  
  The (new) rule of thumb is: if you really want a function call that
  frees a pointer and then assigns it to NULL, then use Curl_safefree().
  But we will prefer just using free() from now on.

  connect: Fix happy eyeballs logic for IPv4-only builds
  
  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
  
  (trynextip)
  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
  
  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
  used by the "other" address family.
  
  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
  example of the bug is shown below.
  
  Assume MTEST resolves to 3 addresses 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4:
  
  * STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1046 (connection #-5000)
  * Rebuilt URL to: http://MTEST/
  * Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members
  * STATE: CONNECT => WAITRESOLVE handle 0x64f4b0; line 1083
  (connection #0)
  *   Trying 127.0.0.2...
  * STATE: WAITRESOLVE => WAITCONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1163

  hostip: Fix signal race in Curl_resolv_timeout.
  
  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
  the function if alarm() goes off.
  
  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
  
  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
  
  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

- openssl: remove all uses of USE_SSLEAY
  
  SSLeay was the name of the library that was subsequently turned into
  OpenSSL many moons ago (1999). curl does not work with the old SSLeay
  library since years. This is now reflected by only using USE_OPENSSL in
  code that depends on OpenSSL.

  http2: Return error if stream was closed with other than NO_ERROR
  
  Previously, we just ignored error code passed to
  on_stream_close_callback and just return 0 (success) after stream
  closure even if stream was reset with error.  This patch records error
  code in on_stream_close_callback, and return -1 and use CURLE_HTTP2
  error code on abnormal stream closure.

- tool: Updated the warnf() function to use the GlobalConfig structure
  
  As the 'error' and 'mute' options are now part of the GlobalConfig,
  rather than per Operation, updated the warnf() function to use this
  structure rather than the OperationConfig.

- build: Removed DataExecutionPrevention directive from VC9+ project files
  
  Removed the DataExecutionPrevention directive from the project files for
  Visual Studio 2008 and above. The XML value in the VC9 project files was
  set to "0" (Default) whilst the VC10+ project files contained an empty
  XML element.

- build: Use default RandomizedBaseAddress directive in VC9+ project files
  
  Visual Studio 2008 introduced support for the address space layout
  randomization (ASLR) feature of Windows Vista. However, upgrading the
  VC8 project files to VC9 and above disabled this feature.
  
  Removed the RandomizedBaseAddress directive to enabled the default
  setting (/DYNAMICBASE). Note: This doesn't appear to have any negative
  impact when compiled and ran on Windows XP.

- nss: do not skip Curl_nss_seed() if data is NULL
  
  In that case, we only skip writing the error message for failed NSS

- nss: improve error handling in Curl_nss_random()
  
  The vtls layer now checks the return value, so it is no longer necessary
  to abort if a random number cannot be provided by NSS.  This also fixes
  the following Coverity report:
  
  Error: FORWARD_NULL (CWE-476):

  This reverts commit 03fa576833643c67579ae216c4e7350fa9b5f2fe.

- telnet.c: fix invalid use of custom read function if not being set
  
  obj_count can be 1 if the custom read function is set or the stdin
  handle is a reference to a pipe. Since the pipe should be handled
  using the PeekNamedPipe-check below, the custom read function should
  only be used if it is actually enabled.

- telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function
  
  According to [1]: "Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library
  and cause it to stop the current transfer."
  This change makes the Windows telnet code handle this case accordingly.

  configure: allow both --with-ca-bundle and --with-ca-path
  
  SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations by default (and if given non-Null
  parameters) searches the CAfile first and falls back to CApath.  This
  allows for CAfile to be a basis (e.g. installed by the package manager)
  and CApath to be a user configured directory.

  timeval: typecast for better type (on Amiga)
  
  There is an issue with conflicting "struct timeval" definitions with
  certain AmigaOS releases and C libraries, depending on what gets
  included when.  It's a minor difference - the OS one is unsigned,
  whereas the common structure has signed elements.  If the OS one ends up
  getting defined, this causes a timing calculation error in curl.
  
  It's easy enough to resolve this at the curl end, by casting the
  potentially errorneous calculation to a signed long.

  nss: add support for the Certificate Status Request TLS extension
  
  Also known as "status_request" or OCSP stapling, defined in RFC6066 section 8.
  
  This requires NSS 3.15 or higher.

- [Alessandro Ghedini brought this change]

  gtls: add support for the Certificate Status Request TLS extension
  
  Also known as "status_request" or OCSP stapling, defined in RFC6066 section 8.
  
  This requires GnuTLS 3.1.3 or higher to build, however it's recommended to use
  at least GnuTLS 3.3.11 since previous versions had a bug that caused the OCSP
  response verfication to fail even on valid responses.

- [Alessandro Ghedini brought this change]

  url: add CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS option
  
  This option can be used to enable/disable certificate status verification using
  the "Certificate Status Request" TLS extension defined in RFC6066 section 8.
  
  This also adds the CURLE_SSL_INVALIDCERTSTATUS error, to be used when the
  certificate status verification fails, and the Curl_ssl_cert_status_request()
  function, used to check whether the SSL backend supports the status_request
  extension.

- ldap: Pass write length in all Curl_client_write() calls
  
  As we get the length for the DN and attribute variables, and we know

  curl_schannel.h:123: warning: right-hand operand of comma expression

  Some instances of the curlssl_close_all() function were declared with a
  void return type whilst others as int. The schannel version returned
  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and others simply returned zero, but in all cases the
  return code was ignored by the calling function Curl_ssl_close_all().
  
  For the time being and to keep the internal API consistent, changed all
  declarations to use a void return type.
  
  To reduce code we might want to consider removing the unimplemented
  versions and use a void #define like schannel does.

  ...as calloc() automatically clears the area of memory with zeros.

- asiohiper.cpp: Updated for curl coding standards
  
  ...with the exception of the start of block statement curly brackets.

- code/docs: Use correct case for IPv4 and IPv6
  
  For consistency, as we seem to have a bit of a mixed bag, changed all
  instances of ipv4 and ipv6 in comments and documentations to use the
  correct case.

- runtests: Fixed detection of Unix Sockets feature
  
  ...following change in curl --version output.

- code/docs: Use Unix rather than UNIX to avoid use of the trademark
  
  Use Unix when generically writing about Unix based systems as UNIX is
  the trademark and should only be used in a particular product's name.

- ip2ip.c: Fixed compilation warning when IPv6 Scope ID not supported
  
  if2ip.c:119: warning: unused parameter 'remote_scope_id'
  
  ...and some minor code style policing in the same function.

- vtls: Don't set cert info count until memory allocation is successful
  
  Otherwise Curl_ssl_init_certinfo() can fail and set the num_of_certs
  member variable to the requested count, which could then be used
  incorrectly as libcurl closes down.

- vtls: Use CURLcode for Curl_ssl_init_certinfo() return type
  
  The return type for this function was 0 on success and 1 on error. This
  was then examined by the calling functions and, in most cases, used to
  return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
  
  Instead use CURLcode for the return type and return the out of memory
  error directly, propagating it up the call stack.

- configure: Use camel case for UNIX sockets feature output
  
  To match the curl --version output.

Marc Hoersken (26 Dec 2014)
- sockfilt.c: Reduce the number of individual memory allocations
  
  Merge multiple internal arrays into one, even if some variables
  will not not be used. They are all created with the number of
  file descriptors as their size.
  
  Also fix possible thread handle leak in CloseHandle-loop.

- sockfilt.c: Replace 100ms sleep with thread throttle
  
  Improves performance of test cases 574 and 575 by 50%.
  
  A value of zero causes the thread to relinquish the remainder
  of its time slice to any other thread of equal priority that is
  ready to run. If there are no other threads of equal priority
  ready to run, the function returns immediately, and the thread
  continues execution.

Steve Holme (25 Dec 2014)
- tool_help: Use camel case for UNIX sockets feature output
  
  In line with the other features listed in the --version output,
  capitalise the UNIX socket feature.

- vtls: Use bool for Curl_ssl_getsessionid() return type
  
  The return type of this function is a boolean value, and even uses a
  bool internally, so use bool in the function declaration as well as
  the variables that store the return value, to avoid any confusion.

- config-win32.h: Fixed line length > 79 columns

- openssl: Prefer we don't use NULL in comparisons

- build: Removed WIN32 definition from the Visual Studio projects
  
  As this pre-processor definition is defined in curl_setup.h there is no
  need to include it in the Visual Studio project files.

- build: Removed WIN64 definition from the libcurl Visual Studio projects
  
  Removed the WIN64 pre-processor definition from the libcurl project
  files as:
  
  * WIN64 is not used in our source code
  * The curl projects files don't define it
  * It isn't required by or used in the platform SDK
  * For backwards compatability curl_setup.h defines WIN32
  * The compiler automatically defines _WIN64 for x64 builds
  
  Historically Visual Studio projects have defined WIN32, in addition to
  the compiler defined _WIN32 definition, and I had incorrectly changed
  that to WIN64 for the x64 libcurl builds but not in the curl projects.
  
  As such, it is questionable whether this should be defined or not. For
  more information see the following cache of a discussion that took
  place on the microsoft.public.vc.mfc newsgroup:

Steve Holme (20 Dec 2014)
- non-ascii: Reduce variable usage
  
  Removed 'next' variable in Curl_convert_form(). Rather than setting it
  from 'form->next' and using that to set 'form' after the conversion
  just use 'form = form->next' instead.

- non-ascii: Prefer while loop rather than a do loop
  
  This also removes the need to check that the 'form' argument is valid.

- non-ascii: Reduce variable scope
  
  As 'result' isn't used out side the conversion callback code and
  previously caused variable shadowing in the libiconv based code.

- non-ascii: We prefer 'CURLcode result'
  
  This also fixes a variable shadowing issue when HAVE_ICONV is defined
  as rc was declared for the result code of libiconv based functions.

- if2ip: dummy scope parameter for Curl_if2ip() call in SIOCGIFADDR-enabled code.

- [Kyle J. McKay brought this change]

  parseurlandfillconn(): fix improper non-numeric scope_id stripping.
  Fixes SF bug 1149: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1449/

- IPV6: address scope != scope id
  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
    addresses.
  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
  to bind to an interface.
  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
  the interface index.
  
  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

- connect: singleipconnect(): properly try other address families after failure

- SFTP: work-around servers that return zero size on STAT
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-12/0103.html
  Pathed-by: Marc Renault

- glob_next_url: make the loop count upwards
  
  As the former contruct apparently caused a compiler warning, mentioned
  in d8efde07e556c.

- tool_operate: we prefer 'CURLcode result'

- tool_urlglob: unify return codes to use CURLcode
  
  There was a mix of GlobCode, CURLcode and ints and they were mostly
  passing around CURLcode errors. This change makes the functions use only
  CURLcode and removes the GlobCode type completely.

- tool_urlglob.c: partly reverse dc19789444
  
  The loop in glob_next_url() needs to be done backwards to maintain the
  logic. dc19789444 caused test 1235 to fail.

- KNOWN_BUGS: the SFTP code doesn't support CURLINFO_FILETIME

- [Jay Satiro brought this change]

  opts: Warn CURLOPT_TIMEOUT overrides when set after CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS
  
  Change CURLOPT_TIMEOUT doc to warn that if CURLOPT_TIMEOUT and
  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS are both set whichever one is set last is the one
  that will be used.
  
  Prior to this change that behavior was only noted in the
  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS doc.

- tool_urlglob.c: reverse two loops
  
  By counting from 0 and up instead of backwards like before, we remove
  the need for the "funny" check of the unsigned variable when decreased
  passed zero. Easier to read and less risk for compiler warnings.

- tool_urlglob.c: Added braces to clarify the conditions

- tool_urlglob.c: Silence warning C6293: Ill-defined for-loop

  smtp.c:2386 warning: adding 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') to a string
              does not append to the string
  
  Used array index notation instead.

- smb: Disable SMB when 64-bit integers are not supported
  
  This fixes compilation issues with compilers that don't support 64-bit
  integers through long long or __int64.

- ntlm: Disable NTLM v2 when 64-bit integers are not supported
  
  This fixes compilation issues with compilers that don't support 64-bit
  integers through long long or __int64 which was introduced in commit
  07b66cbfa4.

- ntlm: Allow NTLM2Session messages when USE_NTRESPONSES manually defined
  
  Previously USE_NTLM2SESSION would only be defined automatically when
  USE_NTRESPONSES wasn't already defined. Separated the two definitions
  so that the user can manually set USE_NTRESPONSES themselves but
  USE_NTLM2SESSION is defined automatically if they don't define it.

- smtp.c: Fixed line longer than 79 columns

- config-win32.h: Don't enable Windows Crypt API if using OpenSSL
  
  As the OpenSSL and NSS Crypto engines are prefered by the core NTLM
  routines, to the Windows Crypt API, don't define USE_WIN32_CRYPT
  automatically when either OpenSSL or NSS are in use - doing so would
  disable NTLM2Session responses in NTLM type-3 messages.

- smtp: Fixed inappropriate free of the scratch buffer
  
  If the scratch buffer was allocated in a previous call to
  Curl_smtp_escape_eob(), a new buffer not allocated in the subsequent
  call and no action taken by that call, then an attempt would be made to
  try and free the buffer which, by now, would be part of the data->state
  structure.
  
  This bug was introduced in commit 4bd860a001.

- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing when EOL characters were at end of input buffers
  
  Fixed a problem with the CRLF. detection when multiple buffers were
  used to upload an email to libcurl and the line ending character(s)
  appeared at the end of each buffer. This meant any lines which started
  with . would not be escaped into .. and could be interpreted as the end
  of transmission string instead.
  
  This only affected libcurl based applications that used a read function
  and wasn't reproducible with the curl command-line tool.
