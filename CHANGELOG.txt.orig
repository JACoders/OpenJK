(Dusty's Patch changelog)
cvars to-do:
separate cvars into global and savegame versions, have global take priority?
camera cvars?
cvars for force push blur effects?

increased modability:
- separate lightning block effect into own .efx file
- external file for controlling force push/pull/absorb/protect effects
- Class_Wookiee, Class_Cultist
- weapons.dat stuff (npcDamageMult, npcSpeedMult)
- alt-fire field works for .npc files?
- other .npc fields:
fastPunches, kicks, freeMovement, aggression = punching...
- 

other:
- kick knockdown based on hit location
- better Jedi AI
- NPCs avoid walls and cliffs
- better saber throws, strong force push

Test:
- cultist punch delay
- gran punch decisions vs. saber wielder
- npc surrender
- lightning block effect
- force protect saber damage
- faster non-heavy punches

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Only larger/more important changes recorded here:
new cvars:
g_autoRoll - been there for a while, now works 100% correctly, if 1
default JA behavior, if 0 you have to be holding USE to roll
g_char_forcePowerMax - requires level restart, like the NPC setting but for the player
g_char_forceRegen - requires level restart, like NPC setting but for player
g_char_parryBonus - like the .sab file setting but applied on game load for player
g_char_breakParryBonus - like the .sab file setting but applied on game load for player
all these affect the player's stats
g_handicap - goes up to 200 now
g_saberDamageScale - this scales saber damage, and is saved with your savegame
g_saberForceDrains - if 1 special moves drain the amount of FP from the
next cvar, katas not affected
g_saberForceDrainAmount - if g_saberForceDrains is 1, special moves
drain this amount of FP, katas not affected
g_saberLockSuperBreaks - if 1 default JA behavior of saber locks, if 0
no super breaks (1-hit KOs) ever happen after saber locks
g_saberLockStyle - dummy cvar. Later maybe make it so superbreaks happen
under certain conditions
g_saberMoreRealistic - no longer write-protected
g_weaponVelocity, g_weaponAltVelocity - use this to multiply the speed of most projectiles

Gameplay mechanics -
Force powers -- (with g_forceNewPowers 1)
- Force Jump height for all levels increased by 25%
- Force Pull level 1 pulls weapons only, level 2 can knockdown, level 3 can pull toward you somewhat
- Force Sense gives limited snipershot dodging ability
- Force Speed decreases cost of sniper shot dodging at Level 3
- Force Protect 1/2/3 gives only 10/20/40% damage reduction against saber attacks instead of 25/50/75%

NPC AI --
- Improvements to NPC AI pertaining to the use of JA-exclusive abilities;
NPCs only use Force Rage if close to the player and if have > 25% HP, only kick if close to the player,
only use katas if close to the player
- NPC Jedi will try very hard to dodge your attacks if you knock their saber throw to the ground
- NPC Jedi get up much more quickly on higher difficulties (no easy marios for the win)
- NPC Jedi will activate their saber very quickly after being gripped or drained based on difficulty and rank
- Force Cultists react properly to explosives, sniper shots, and saber throws now
- Non-saber wielding NPCs with Class_Reborn try extra hard to dodge saber attacks and throws (because they can't block)
- Light Jedi with non-dark Jedi AI (class_reborn, class_desann, etc.) classes don't attack surrendered or unarmed enemies now
- Grenadier Grans will alternate punches/thermal detonators even if your saber is out if you are really close to
them.
- NPCs surrender better... (to-do)
NPC other --
- Allied NPCs receive 150%/125%/100% HP for Padawan/Jedi/Jedi Knight difficulties now instead of 100/125/150 like enemy
npcs
- Assassin Droids now fire even with their shields up
- Class_Rodian with E11 and Class_Imperial at commander rank use alt-fire now always
 

Saber System: *(with g_saberNewCombat 1)
* saber offense and defense increase your offense and defensive strength in parries:
 - offense controls your power level (+2/4/6), and is modified by saber style (-2/0/+2/-1/+1/-1/+1 for fast/med/strong/duals
   /staff/tavion/desann), defense controls your defense strength (+2/4/6, not affected by saber style)
 - if an attack powerlevel is greater than defense strength, you can still block it but you lose some block points
 - if you lose enough block points, your guard is crushed; block points regenerate while walking/standing still and not attacking
 - special attacks don't drain block points but either break through completely or are blocked partially
* red/strong can be blocked now, but is faster and less unwieldy (and more realistic I think)
* staff and duals cannot chain

- at higher difficulties, blaster bolts are deflected in the direction of the crosshair instead of being auto-aimed
- your ability to parry saber attacks (TO DO) and deflect blaster fire is slightly improved while walking/standing still
- you do a full slash even if starting with your saber off -- TO DO
- Desann style is full strength if you are CLASS_DESANN, otherwise it is a cross between medium/strong
(it has the same power level as staff, and can knock down enemies but is unlikely to)
- attack chain amounts tweaked slightly, not random now (not completely), can only chain 2 slashes if running,
staff and duals cannot chain infinitely (5 slash maximum now)
- staff power is nerfed so it is not as strong as strong style now, but slightly more powerful than medium
- staff sabers are now thrown double-bladed

Melee changes:
- Player gets a weaker version of melee katas now based on saber offense level (1 - punches and kicks, 2 - katas, 3 - spin kicks)
- Player melee katas have less range, must be aimed more precisely, and do not work on certain types of enemies
- Spin kicks and the like are enabled for Saber Offense 3 and do slightly more damage
- Can do spin kicks on demand by holding Use and pressing the kick button, however this costs Force power
- kicks knocking down an enemy jedi depends on your saber offense vs. their saber defense
- Player punches do 7/5 damage now instead of 6/3 and aren't randomized now
- Force Speed punching is more consistent now and less cheap -- test
- Heavy melee is specifically associated with Chewbacca, Class_Gran, and Class_Trandoshan, other NPC types will punch
more quickly but weaker if given WP_MELEE -- test & fix

Other additions -
- Save games allow for screenshots now like JK2 -- fix
- Visual effect for blocking Force Lightning with your lightsaber
- handicap can go up to 200
- r_dynamicglowintensity cvar is saved and written to jaconfig now
- rolls and acrobatics are possible in 1st person view


Things to do -
- Savegame screenshots working in the loading screen - got broken
- handicap cvar going past 100, separate cvar for player HP and Shields - partial done
- Reborn masters with constant saber throwing + lightning
- NPCs avoid cliffs? -- not able
- NPCDamageMult, NPCAltDamageMult, saber ignition/deignition time fields in weapons.dat
- Force push strong version, mindtrick changes - not done
- Doing a full slash when starting saber off - not done
- camera controls (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th person)
- Fix NPCs surrendering
