# OpenJK "Jedi Outcast" Singleplayer Code #

This folder contains the partial source required to build the JK2 shared library, which when built will enable the user to run JK2 in 
OpenJK as long as the command line arguments +set com_jk2 1 are enabled.
This folder has a compile time dependency on the main code tree.
